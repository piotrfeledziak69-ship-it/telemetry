- Keep qualifying playback in the native React shell with pure timing helpers; summary uploads contain lap times, not measured movement coordinates.
- Keep racing-line points normalized and calibrated per track in one owner-published site collection shared by Qualifying and ERS; device storage is export-only and replacement artwork requires independent calibration.
- Load AI debrief sessions through the tested browser query helper with explicit database-column aliases, so stored position names cannot diverge from analysis fields.
- Keep legacy constructor lookup regression tests against the analyzer's actual helper code; explicit session seasons prevent cross-season fallback and grid-backfill contamination.
